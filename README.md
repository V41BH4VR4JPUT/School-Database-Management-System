1. adding new details of the student into the database using vectors from STL library.
2. diplay of the database you created by adding data of students i used auto keyword with const so no one can change anything
3. deleting the uneccesary data or wrong data here i used iterators with vectors functions 
4. update the student details
5. stream allocation added new feature from which you can identify either the student eligible or not.
