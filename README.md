# School-Database-Management-System
Creating a system for adding students in the database with many other features.
<br>
In this project i added feature like :

 1. ADD DATA 
 2. DISPLAY DATA 
 3. DELETE DATA 
 4. UPDATE DATA 
 5. STREAM ALLOCATION 
 6. EXIT 
       
1. adding new details of the student into the database using vectors from STL library.
2. diplay of the database you created by adding data of students i used auto keyword with const so no one can change anything
3. deleting the uneccesary data or wrong data here i used iterators with vectors functions 
4. update the student details
5. stream allocation added new feature from which you can identify either the student eligible or not.
